# linq

## Description
Built as a capstone final project at DevBootcamp, a 19-week immersive coding school, Linq is an iOS application built in Swift decoupled with a Ruby on Rails back-end server. Linq is designed to improve the networking experience by allowing users to instantly exchange contact information via iBeacon technology. 

Linq is an on-going project and is still in development. We are continuing to work on this project and we are open to feedback.
